__Web Programming Internship Internal Project Final Report__

Website for having user driven Animal stats

Student: John Spink
Project: Animal Stats Chart

Starting date: 11/1/19

Completion date: 12/10/19

Total hours: 40


__Project info__
The project Animal stats chart would have users enter the stats of animals in to their own database. Then bring all the users data together and average them to display on the front page. The web page also has a search feature that lets you search for animals and see all of the animals users have created.  Users can edit or delete any of their animals that they wish. An account with an admin role can delete any animal they wish from any user on an admin page.

__Technologies used__
The project is coded in Java Using the hibernate framework With a generic DAO. I also used project lombok which is a Java Library that automatically creates the getters and setters using annotations.  I Used Log 4j and junit to test my methods with a test database. The formatting for the website is done with bootstrap and separate JSP files for reusability.

__What I learned__
I learned that you should create a test database and your original database at the same time so they're the exact same I had to redo my databases at least once because they had slight differences. I also learned that I need to read more about hibernates aggregate functions because it has quite in depth documents with some depreciated methods. What else I learned is that I should test my exception handling each time I have an exception being thrown.
